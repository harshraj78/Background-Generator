# Background-Generator
My background changing project is a simple yet fun project that I learned to make from a JavaScript tutorial. The project involves changing the background of a webpage using JavaScript and HTML. By clicking a button, the user can cycle through a set of pre-defined backgrounds or upload their own image to use as the background.
